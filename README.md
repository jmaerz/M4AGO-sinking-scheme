# M<sup>4</sup>AGO sinking scheme 

Microstructure, Multiscale, Mechanistic, Marine Aggregates in the Global Ocean (M<sup>4</sup>AGO) sinking scheme


Both, the package and the description are in development, while the code provides the functionality as originally published in 

Maerz et al. 2020: Microstructure and composition of marine aggregates
                    as co-determinants for vertical particulate organic
                    carbon transfer in the global ocean.

## How To?
### Use the package
The package requires an interface, where the driving ocean biogeochemical model provides certain parameters and primary particle information generated from the model. Thus far, M<sup>4</sup>AGO is applied in variants of the HAMOCC (HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle) model. With the re-writing and separation into the wrapper functions and the M<sup>4</sup>AGO core module, it becomes easier to integrate and extend the M<sup>4</sup>AGO sinking scheme to other biogeochemical models.
